Overview
========

For seamlessly (as far as possible) switching between different network
locations.

 - Home
 - Reith
 - everywhere else

Switches proxy settings, and so forth.

Usage
=====

I use ControlPlane ( http://www.controlplaneapp.com/about/ ) to work out when
to switch.  ControlPlane is then configured to run the
./reconfigure-for-location script.

Prerequisites
=============

daemontools, for logging.
ruby, for XML mangling.
bash & perl, for general admin.
