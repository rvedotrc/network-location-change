Overview
========

For seamlessly (as far as possible) switching between different network
locations.

 - Home
 - Reith
 - everywhere else

Switches proxy settings, and so forth.

Usage
=====

I use ControlPlane ( http://www.controlplaneapp.com/about/ ) to work out when
to switch.  ControlPlane is then configured to run the
./reconfigure-for-location script.

Prerequisites
=============

daemontools, for logging.
ruby, for XML mangling.
bash & perl, for general admin.

Hooking it all up
=================

ControlPlane runs the script (actually a wrapper script in ~/bin which adds
more logging - probably unnecessary).

~/.bashrc includes the line:
  . $HOME/git/github.com/rvedotrc/network-location-change/bashrc

~/.m2/settings.xml is a symlink:
  lrwxr-xr-x  1 rachel  staff  80 28 Dec 09:47 /Users/rachel/.m2/settings.xml -> /Users/rachel/git/github.com/rvedotrc/network-location-change/maven-settings.xml

tsocks.conf??? I don't really use that any more.
